# Ephemeral
### Blog with expiration
A platform for blogging in the moment.

## Uses
Ephemeral, an open source, index- and copy-resistant blogging platform that allows users to blog with an expiration date. 

This has many use cases:
 * Time-sensitive press releases
 * Secure, trusted public communication (posts will be hashed with private/public keys)
 * Blogging when/where freedom of speech is oppressed

## Goals
The goal of this platform is simple: 
1. Create a blogging platform that will *automatically expire old posts*
2. A fast, simple, and reliable blogging experience
3. Secure public communication through the use of private/public keys and hashed content
3. Built on the Markdown standard
4. Easily modifiable, easily styled

## Development
We use [Browserstack](http://browserstack.com) to aid our development.
